I don't know how this works
but the files for javascript Mastermind are here
eventually it will be fully customizable Mastermind

//CONTROLS
click on start to start the game, options doesn't do anything yet
left/right arrows to change where you want to put a color
up/down arrows to change which color to place
enter to place a color
space to make a guess
click on reset to reset the game
//RULES
rules are the same as classic mastermind:
the amount of red squares is how many colors in your guess are in the right location
the amount of white squares is how many colors in your guess are misplaced
